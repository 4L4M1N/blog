Finally we get .NET Core 1.0 RTM and ASP.​NET Core 1.0 RTM. Yesterday Microsoft announces the release of .NET Core 1.0 and ASP.​NET Core 1.0.

[Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) posted a great summery about it: [.NET Core 1.0 is now released!](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/NETCore10IsNowReleased.aspx) You'll find more detailed information about .NET Core 1.0 on the [.NET Blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/) in the Post "[Announcing .NET Core 1.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/06/27/announcing-net-core-1-0/)"  and pretty much detailed information about ASP.​NET Core 1.0 in the [.NET Web Development and Tools Blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/) in the post "[Announcing ASP.NET Core 1.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2016/06/27/announcing-asp-net-core-1-0/)"

Updating exiting .NET Core RC applications to the RTM, needs some attention. (Not as much as from RC1 to RC2, but there is a little bit to do). First of all: The [Visual Studio 2015 Update 3](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/06/27/visual-studio-2015-update-3-and-net-core-1-0-available-now/) is needed, as pretty much mentioned in all of the Blog posts. To learn more about the need things to do, [Rick Strahl](https://weblog.west-wind.com/) posted a great and pretty detailed post about updating an existing application: [Upgrading to ASP.NET Core RTM from RC2](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2016/Jun/27/Upgrading-to-ASPNET-Core-RTM-from-RC2)
