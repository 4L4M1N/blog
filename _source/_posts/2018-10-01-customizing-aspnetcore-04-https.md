HTTPS is on by default now and a first class feature. On Windows the certificate which is needed to enable HTTPS is loaded from the windows certificate store. If you create a project on Linux and Mac the certificate is loaded from a certificate file. 

> Even if you want to create a project to run it behind and IIS or an NGinX webserver HTTPS is enabled. Usually you would manage the certificate on the IIS or NGinX webserver in that case. But this shouldn't be a problem and you shouldn't disable HTTPS in the ASP.NET Core settings.

Services like background services for a micro service based applications, or services in a self hosted ASP.NET Core application.

There are some scenarios where it makes sense to also load the certificate from a file on Windows. This could be in an application that you will run on docker for Windows, and also on docker for Linux.

Personally I like the flexible way to load the certificate from a file.
