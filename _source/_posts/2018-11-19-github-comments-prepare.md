I'm going to remove the Disqus comments on this blog and move to GitHib Issue based comments. The reason is, that I don't want to have advertisements that are not related to the contents of this page. The other reason is, that I want to have the full control over the comments.

## I'm going to remove Disqus from my blog

I'm currently migrating all the Disqus comments to GitHub issues. There will be an GitHub issue per blog post and the issue comments will be the blog post comments than. I will use the hierarchy but this isn't really needed. Another downside for the readers is, that they will need to have an GiHub account to create comments. Otherwise the most of you already have one and you don't need to have an Discus account anymore to drop a comment.

To do the migration I'll remove Disqus first. After a few days of migrating and testing I'll enable the GitHub issue comment on my blog. There will be a comment form on my page and you don't need to go to GitHub to drop a comment. 

I will write a more detailed blog post about the new comment and how I migrated it if it's done.
