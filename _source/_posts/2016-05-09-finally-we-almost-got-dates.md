Every time I watch the ASP.NET Community stand-up, I was pretty curious about the delivery date of ASP.NET Core RC2 and RTM. Last [Scott Hunter](https://twitter.com/coolcsh) wrote about the status and the road-map of .NET Core and the tooling around it.

- In the middle of May
  - .NET Core and ASP.NET Core will be RC2
  - The tooling will be in Preview 1
- By the end of June
  - .NET Core and ASP.NET Core will be RTM
  - The tooling will be in Preview 2

The tooling will be RTM with Visual Studio "15"

Read lot more about it in Scott Hunters post about the [Improvements, Schedule and Roadmap of .NET Core.](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/05/06/net-core-rc2-improvements-schedule-and-roadmap/)
