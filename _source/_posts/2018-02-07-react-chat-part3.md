In this blog series, I'm going to create a small chat application using React and ASP.NET Core, to learn more about React and to learn how React behaves in an ASP.NET Core project during development and deployment. This Series is divided into 5 parts, which should cover all relevant topics:

1. [React Chat Part 1: Requirements & Setup]({% post_url react-chat-part1.md %})
2. [React Chat Part 2: Creating the UI & React Components]({% post_url react-chat-part2.md %})
3. **React Chat Part 3: Adding Websockets using SignalR**
4. React Chat Part 4: Authentication & Storage
5. React Chat Part 5: Deployment to Azure

I also set-up a GitHub repository where you can follow the project: [https://github.com/JuergenGutsch/react-chat-demo](https://github.com/JuergenGutsch/react-chat-demo). Feel free to share your ideas about that topic in the comments below or in issues on GitHub. Because I'm still learning React, please tell me about significant and conceptual errors, by dropping a comment or by creating an Issue on GitHub. Thanks.
