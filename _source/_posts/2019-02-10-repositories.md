The last architectural brain dump I did in my blog was more than three years ago. At that time it was my German blog, which is shut down unfortunately. Anyway, this is another one. This time I want to write about the sense of the repository pattern in combination with an object relational mapper (ORM) like Entity Framework (EF) Core.

In the past years I had some great discussions about the sense of repository pattern. Mostly offline, but also online on twitter or in the comments of this blog.

My idea is you don't need to use repositories, if you use a unit of work. It is not only my idea, but it makes absolutely sense to my and I also favor not to use repositories in case I use EF or EF Core. There are many reasons. Let's look at them. 

## YAGNI - you ain't gonna need it

In the classic architecture pattern you had three layers: UI, Business and Data. That made kinda sense in the past, in a world of monolithic applications without ORM. At that time you wrapped all of the SQL and data mapping stuff into the data layer. The actual work with the data was done in the business layer and the user interacted with the data in the UI. This data layer got more and more generic. 

> At least I created generic data layers in the past which generated the SQL based on the type the data need to get mapped to. I used the property information of the types as well as attributes. Just before ORM were a thing in .NET. Yes. I created OR mappers, but I didn't know :-D

Wait... What is a data layer for, if you already use a ORM?

To encapsulate the ORM? Why would you do that? To change the underlaying ORM if needed? When did you ever changed the ORM and why? 

These days you don't need to change the ORM in case you change the database. You only need to change the date provider of the ORM. Because the ORM is generic. 

To not have ORM dependencies in the business and UI layers? You'll ship your app including all dependencies. 

To easier test the business logic in an isolated way, without the ORM? This is anyway possible and you need to test the repositories as well in an isolated way. Just mock the DbContext.

You ain't gone need an additional layer you need to maintain and to test. This is additional senseless code in the most cases. It just increases the lines of code and only makes sense, if you get paid for code instead of solutions

## KISS - keep it simple and stupid

In almost all cases, the simple solution is the best one. Why? Because it is a solution and because it is simple ;-) 

Simple to understand, simple to test and simple to maintain. For the most of us, it is hard to create a simple solution, because our brains are working that way. That's the crux we have as software developers: We are able to understand complex scenarios, write complex programs, building software for self driving cars, video games and space stations. 

In reality our job is to make complex things as simple as possible. The most of us do that, by writing business software that helps a lot of people doing their work in an efficient way that saves a lot of time and money. But often we use rocket science, or we use sky scraper technology to just build a tiny house. 

Why? Because we are developers, we think in a complex way and we really, really love rocket science.

But sometimes we should look for a little simpler solution. Don't write code you don't need. Don't create a complex architecture, if you just need a tiny house. Don't use rocket science to build a car. Keep it simple and stupid. It just need to work for the customer.

## Lemme speak code

Back to the repositories, let's speak some code and let's compare two code snippets. This is just some kind of fake code. But a saw something like this a lot in the past. In the first snippet we have a business layer, which needs three repositories to update some data. Mostly a repository is created per database table or per entity. This is why this business layer need to use two more repositories just to check for additional fields:

~~~ csharp

public class AwesomeBusiness
{
    private readonly AwesomeRepository _awesomeRepository;
    private readonly CoolRepository _coolRepository;
    private readonly SuperRepository _superRepository;

    public AwesomeBusiness(
        AwesomeRepository awesomeRepository,
        CoolRepository coolRepository,
        SuperRepository superRepository)
    {
        _awesomeRepository = awesomeRepository;
        _coolRepository = coolRepository;
        _superRepository = superRepository;
    }
    
    public void UpdateAwesomeness(int id)
    {
        var awesomeness = _awesomeRepository.GetById(id);
        awesomeness.IsCool = _coolRepository.HasCoolStuff(awesomeness.Id);
        awesomeness.IsSuper = _superRepository.HasSuperStuff(awesomeness.Id);
        awesomeness.LastCheck = DateTime.Now;
        _awesomeRepository.UpdateAwesomeness(awesomeness);
    }
}

public class AwesomeRepository
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _dbContext;

    public AwesomeRepository(AppDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    internal void UpdateAwesomeness(Awesomeness awesomeness)
    {
        var aw = _dbContext.Awesomenesses.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Id = awesomeness.Id);
        aw.IsCool = awesomeness.IsCool;
        aw.IsSuper = awesomeness.IsSuper;
        aw.LastCheck = awesomeness.LastCheck;
        _dbContext.SaveChanges();
    }
}

public class SuperRepository
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _dbContext;

    public SuperRepository(AppDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    internal bool HasSuperStuff(int id)
    {
        return _dbContext.SuperStuff.Any(x => x.AwesomenessId == id);
    }
}

public class CoolRepository
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _dbContext;

    public CoolRepository(AppDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    internal bool HasCoolStuff(int id)
    {
        return _dbContext.CoolStuff.Any(x => x.AwesomenessId == id);
    }
}

public class Awesomeness
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public bool IsCool { get; set; }
    public bool IsSuper { get; set; }
    public DateTime LastCheck { get; set; }
}
~~~

Usually the Repositories are much bigger that this small classes, they provide functionality for the default CRUD operations on the object and sometimes some more. 

I've seen a lot of repositories the last 15 years, some where kind generic or planned to be generic. Most of them are pretty individual depending on the needs of that object to work on. This is so much overhead for such a simple feature.

Why not just like this?

~~~ csharp
public class AwesomeService
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _dbContext;

    public AwesomeService(AppDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    public void UpdateAwesomeness(int id)
    {
        var awesomeness = _dbContext.Awesomenesses.First(x => x.Id == id);
        awesomeness.IsCool = _dbContext.CoolStuff.Any(x => x.AwesomenessId == id);
        awesomeness.IsSuper = _dbContext.SuperStuff.Any(x => x.AwesomenessId == id);
        awesomeness.LastCheck = DateTime.Now;

        _dbContext.SaveChanges();
    }
}
~~~

This is simple, less code, less dependencies, easy to understand and anyway working. Sure it uses EF directly. If there is really, really, really the need to encapsulate the ORM. Why don't you create repositories by topic instead of per entity? Let's have a look:

~~~ csharp
public class AwesomeService
{
    private readonly AwesomeRepository _awesomeRepository;

    public AwesomeService(AwesomeRepository awesomeRepository)
    {
        _awesomeRepository = awesomeRepository;
    }     

    public void UpdateAwesomeness(int id)
    {
        _awesomeRepository.UpdateAwesomeness(id);
    }   
}

public class AwesomeRepository
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _dbContext;

    public AwesomeRepository(AppDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    internal void UpdateAwesomeness(int id)
    {
        var awesomeness = _dbContext.Awesomenesses.First(x => x.Id == id);
        awesomeness.IsCool = _dbContext.CoolStuff.Any(x => x.AwesomenessId == id);
        awesomeness.IsSuper = _dbContext.SuperStuff.Any(x => x.AwesomenessId == id);
        awesomeness.LastCheck = DateTime.Now;
        _dbContext.SaveChanges();
    }
}
~~~

This looks clean as well and encapsulates EF pretty well. But why do we really need the AwesomeService in that case? It just calls the repository. It doesn't contain any real logic, but needs to be tested and maintained. I also saw this kind of services a lot the last 15 years. This also doesn't make sense to me. At the end I always ended with the second solution. 

We don't need to have a three layered architecture, because we had the last 20 years. It always depends.

## Architectural point of view

The point of view changed over the last years. I don't look at data objects anymore. If I do architecture I don't use the OOP glasses anymore. I try to explore the data flows inside the solution. Where do the data come from, how do the data transform on the way to the target and where do the data go? I don't think in layers anymore. I try to figure out what is the best way to let the date flow into the right direction.

Depending on the size and the kind of the application, I ended in different kind architectural patterns. Despite what pattern is used, there's no repository anymore. There are services that provide the data in the way I need them in the UI. Sometimes the Services are called Handlers, depending what architectural pattern is used, but they work the same way. Mostly they are completely independent from each other. There's no think like a UserService or GroupService, but there's an AuthService or an ProfileService. There is no ProductService, CategoryService or OrderService, but a ShopService and a CheckOutService.

Does this make sense to you?
