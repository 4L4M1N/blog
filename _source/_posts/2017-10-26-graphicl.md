One nice thing about blogging is the feedback from the readers. I got some nice kudos, but also great new ideas. One idea was born out of a question about a "graphi" UI for the [GraphQL Middleware I wrote]({% post_url graphql-middleware-for-aspnetcore.md %}) some months ago. I never heard about "graphi", which actually is "GraphiQL", a generic HTML UI over a GraphQL endpoint. It seemed to be something like a Swagger UI, but just for GraphQL. That sounds nice and I did some research about that.

## What is GraphiQL?

Actually it is absolutely not the same as Swagger and not as detailed as Swagger, but it provides a simple and easy to use UI to play around with your GraphQL end-point. So you cannot really compare it.

GraphiQL is a React component provided by the GraphQL creators, that can be used in your project. It basically provides an input area to write some GraphQL queries and a button to sent that query to your GrapgQL end-point. You'll than see the result or the error on the right side of the UI.

Additionally it provides some more nice features:

* A history of sent queries, which appears on the left side, if you press the history-button. To reuse previously used queries.
* It rewrites the URL to support linking to a specific query. It stores the query and the variables in the URL, to sent it to someone else, or to bookmark the query to test.
* It actually creates a documentation out of the GraphQL end-point. By clicking at the "Docks" link it opens a documentation about the types used in this API. This is really magic, because it shows the documentation of a type I never requested:

## Implementing GraphiQL

The first idea was to write something like this by my own. But it should be the same as the existing GraphiQL UI. Why not using the existing implementation? Thanks to Steve Sanderson, we have the Node Services for ASP.NET Core. Why not running the existing GraphiQL implementation in a Middleware using the NodeServices?

I tried it with the "apollo-server-module-graphiql" package. I called this small JavaScript to render the graphiql UI and return it back to C# via the NodeSerices:

~~~ javascript
var graphiql = require('apollo-server-module-graphiql');

module.exports = function (callback, options) {
    var data = {
        endpointURL: options.graphQlEndpoint
    };

    var result = graphiql.renderGraphiQL(data);
    callback(null, result);
};
~~~

The usage of that script inside the Middleware looks like this:

~~~ csharp
var file = _env.WebRootFileProvider.GetFileInfo("graphiql.js");
var result = await _nodeServices.InvokeAsync<string>(file.PhysicalPath, _options);
await httpCont
~~~

That works great, but has one problem. It wraps the GraphQL query in a JSON-Object that was posted to the GraphQL end-point. I would need to change the `GraphQlMiddleware` implementation, because of that. The current implementation expects the plain GraphQL query in the POST body.

> What is the most useful approach? Wrapping the GraphQL query in a JSON object or sending the plain query? Any Ideas? What do you use? Please tell me by dropping a comment.

With this approach I'm pretty much dependent to the Apollo developers and need to change my implementation, whenever they change their implementations.

This is why I decided to use the same concept of generating the UI as the "apollo-server-module-graphiql" package but implemented in C#. This unfortunately doesn't need the NodeServices anymore.

I use exact the same generated code as this Node module, but changed the way the query is send to the server. Now the plain query will be sent to the server.

I started playing around with this and added it to the existing project, mentioned here: [GraphQL end-point Middleware for ASP.NET Core]({% post_url graphql-middleware-for-aspnetcore.md %}).

## Using the GraphiqlMiddleware

The result is as easy to use as the `GraphQlMiddleware`. Let's see how it looks to add the Middlewares:

~~~ csharp
if (env.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
	// adding the GraphiQL UI
    app.UseGraphiql(options =>
    {
        options.GraphiqlPath = "/graphiql"; // default
        options.GraphQlEndpoint = "/graph"; // default
    });
}
// adding the GraphQL end point
app.UseGraphQl(options =>
{
    options.GraphApiUrl = "/graph"; // default
    options.RootGraphType = new BooksQuery(bookRepository);
    options.FormatOutput = true; // default: false
});
~~~

As you can see the second Middleware is bound to the first one by using the same path "/graph". I didn't create any hidden dependency between the both Middlewares, to make it ease to use it in various combinations. Maybe you want to use the GraphiQL UI only in the Development or Staging environment as shown in this example.

Now start the web using Visual Studio (press [F5]). The web starts with the default view or API. Add "graphiql" to the URL in the browsers address bar and see what happens. You should see a generated UI for your GraphQL endpoint, where you can now start playing around with our API, testing and debugging it with your current data. (See the screenshots on top.)

I'll create a separate NuGet package for the `GraphiqlMiddleware`. This will not have the `GraphQlMiddleware` as a dependency and could be used completely separate.

## Conclusion

This was a lot easier to implement than expected. Currently there is still some refactoring needed:

* I don't like to have the HMTL and JavaScript code in the C#. I'd like to load that from an embedded resource file, which actually is a HTML file.
* I should add some more configuration options. E.g. to change the theme, as equal to the original Node implementation, to preload queries and results, etc.
* Find a way to use it offline as well. Currently there's a connection to the internet needed to load the CSS and JavaScripts from the CDNs.
