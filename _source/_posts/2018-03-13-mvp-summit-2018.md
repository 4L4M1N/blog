Being a MVP has a lot of benefits. Getting free tools, software and Azure credits are just a few of them. The direct connection to the product group has a lot more value than all software. Even more valuable is the is the fact of being a part of an expert community with [more than 3700 MVPs](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/MvpSearch?kw=&x=16&y=12) from around the world. 

> In fact there are a lot more experts outside the MVP community which are also contributing to the communities of the Microsoft related technologies and tools. Being an MVP also means to find those experts and to nominate them to also get the MVP award. 

The most biggest benefit of being an MVP is the yearly MVP Global Summit in Redmond. Also this year Microsoft invites the MVPs to attend the MVP Global Summit. [More than 2000 MVPs](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mvpawardprogram/2018/02/28/get-ready-for-the-summit/) and Regional Directors were registered to attend the summit.

I also attended the summit this year. It was my third summit and the third chance to interact with the product group and with other MVPs from all over the world.

## The first days in Seattle

This year I decided to arrive one day earlier and to stay in Seattle downtown for the first two nights and the last two nights. This was a great decision. 

The Journey starts in Frankfurt airport where a lot of German, Austrian and Swiss MVPs start their jurney and where many more MVPs from Europe change the plain. The LH490 and LH491 flights around the summits are called the MVP plains because of this. This always feels like a yearly huge school trip to a familiar location.

The flight was great, sunny the most time, with an impressive view over Greenland:

After we arrived in SEATEC, some German MVP friends and me took the train to Seattle downtown. We checked in to the hotels and went for a beer and a burger.

I spent the nights just a few steps away from the pike place. I really love the special atmosphere at this place and the area. There are a lot of small stores, small restaurants, the farmers market and the breweries. Also the very first Starbucks restaurant is at this place. It's really a special place. This also allows me to use the public transportation, which works great in Seattle. There is a direct train from the airport to Seattle Downtown and an express bus from Seattle downtown to the center of Bellevue where the conference hotels are located.

## The Summit days

After checking-in into the my conference hotel on Sunday morning, I went to the registration, but it seemed I was pretty early:

But it wasn't really true. The most of the MVPs where in the queue to register for the conference and to get their swag.

Like the last years, the summit days where amazing, even if we don't really learn a lot new things. The most stuff in the my MVP category is open source and openly discussed on GitHub and Twitter and in the blog posts written by Microsoft. Anyway we learned about some great ideas, which I unfortunately cannot write down here, because it is almost all NDA content.

So the most amazing things about the summit are the events and parties around the conference and to meet all the famous MVPs and Microsoft employees. I'm not really a selfie guy, but this time I really need to take a picture with the Amazing Phil "Mister ASP.NET MVC" Haack.

I'm also glad to met Steve Gorden, Andrew Lock, David Pine, Damien Bowden, Fabian Gosebrink, Mark Aliborne, and many more.

I'm also pretty glad to meet Jeff Fritz in Person and to do a lighning talk in front of many program managers during the summit. I was quite nervous, but it worked out well.
