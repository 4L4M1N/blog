I wasn't really sporty before one and a half years, but anyway active. I was also forced to be active with three little kids and a sporty and lovely women. But anyway, a job where I mostly sit in a chair, even great food and good southern German beers also did its work. When I first met my wife, I had around 80 Kg, what is good for my size of 178cm. But my weight increased up to 105Kg until Christmas 2015. This was way too much I thought. Until then I always tried to reduce it by doing some more cycling, more hiking and some gym But it didn't really work. 

Anyway, there is not a more effective way to loose weight than running. It is btw. tree times more effective than cycling. I tried it a lot in the past, but it pretty much hurts in the lower legs and I stopped it. 

Running the agile way

I tried it again in Easter 2016 in a little different way, at it worked. I tried to do it the same way as in a perfect software project:

I did it in an agile way, using pretty small user stories to get as much success as possible.

It sounds weird and funny but it worked really. I lost 20 Kg since then!
