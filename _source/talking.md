Sometimes I got asked to talk on a conference or on a user group. I also did some talks on my own user group in Basel and previously in Konstanz/Kreuzlingen

## Note for conference hoster

I'm not one of the best speakers, I'm not a professional speaker, but I try my best to deliver good and valuable content. I anyway add some important notes to people who ask me to do a talk on a commercial conference.

### Commercial conferences

I don't do a talk for free on a commercial conference. Just because it is a "commercial conference" and because you earn a lot of money from the attendees and sponsors. If you ask me for a talk on your conference, be sure that I'll I ask for a fee per session, additional to the travel cost and free logging during the conference. I don' want to get a lot of money out of the talks, but the talks need to cover the costs to prepare the talk and to stay at the conference. 

### Free and community driven events

On the other hand, I really like to support free and community driven events, by doing a talk, without any costs. (Covered traveling cost are always nice, but is not a must, depending on travel time and distance.) With this kind of events, I mean user group meetings, free meetups, community conferences, charity conferences or conferences which are 100% free for the attendees.

## Do you want me talk on your event?
