title: "DNX libraries vs. UWP libraries"
teaser: "in this blog post I wanted to write about the differences of DNX libraries and UWP  libraries. Are there any? How do we support UWP in DNX libraries and it is possible to support .NET Core in WP libraries? Let's have a look."

Universal Windows Platform (UWP) libraries and DNX libraries are almost equal, they use the same new project type based on a project.json configuration file. Both project types are using NuGet to reference libraries. In fact these libraries are equal, except one small thing. DNX Libraries are creating NuGet Packages on build/publish and UWP libraries are creating unpacked DLLs.

If you want to migrate your library to .NET Core, you can one of those project types. You only need to decide whether to create only the DLLs or to create NuGet Packages. In Both cases you are able to be compatible to .NET Core, UWP, or any other Platform or framework.

## Really?

Yes, it is like this. :) In Visual Studio 2015 I created a solution with two projects. One of them is a UWP library and the other one is a DNX library:

They look almost similar, but let's have a look at the project.json files. This is the project.json of the DNX library:

~~~ jsonp
{
  "version": "1.0.0-*",
  "description": "ClassLibrary5 Class Library",
  "authors": [ "Juergen" ],
  "tags": [ "" ],
  "projectUrl": "",
  "licenseUrl": "",

  "frameworks": {
    "net451": { },
    "dotnet5.4": {
      "dependencies": {
        "Microsoft.CSharp": "4.0.1-beta-23516",
        "System.Collections": "4.0.11-beta-23516",
        "System.Linq": "4.0.1-beta-23516",
        "System.Runtime": "4.0.21-beta-23516",
        "System.Threading": "4.0.11-beta-23516"
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~

And this is the project.json of the UWP library:

~~~ jsonp
{
  "dependencies": {
    "Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform": "5.0.0"
  },
  "frameworks": {
    "uap10.0": {}
  },
  "runtimes": {
    "win10-arm": {},
    "win10-arm-aot": {},
    "win10-x86": {},
    "win10-x86-aot": {},
    "win10-x64": {},
    "win10-x64-aot": {}
  }
}
~~~

In the DNX libaries, you can also have a "dependency" item in the root to specify dependencies which can be used in both frameworks. Let's create a DNX library which supports UWP:

~~~ jsonp

"frameworks": {
  "net451": { },
  "dotnet5.4": {
    "dependencies": {
      "Microsoft.CSharp": "4.0.1-beta-23516",
      "System.Collections": "4.0.11-beta-23516",
      "System.Linq": "4.0.1-beta-23516",
      "System.Runtime": "4.0.21-beta-23516",
      "System.Threading": "4.0.11-beta-23516"
    }
  },
  "uap10.0": {
    "dependencies": {
      "Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform": "5.0.0"
    }
  }
}
~~~

I added the dependency directly to the specific framework, because this guy will not be compatible with the other frameworks. This library will restore the missing packages when you save the project.json  

I'm also able to add .NET Core support to the UWP library:

~~~ jsonp
"frameworks": {
  "uap10.0": {
    "dependencies": {
      "Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform": "5.0.0"
    }
  },
  "dotnet5.4": {
    "dependencies": {
      "Microsoft.CSharp": "4.0.1-beta-23516",
      "System.Collections": "4.0.11-beta-23516",
      "System.Linq": "4.0.1-beta-23516",
      "System.Runtime": "4.0.21-beta-23516",
      "System.Threading": "4.0.11-beta-23516"
    }
  }
}
~~~

The missing NuGet Packages will be restored, if you build this library. By the way: There already are conditional compiler symbols defined in the Build options to switch between .NET Core and UWP specific implementations:
![](/img/core-vs-uwp/uwp-build-options.png)

~~~ csharp
#if NETFX_CORE
        // access .NET Core specific APIs here
#endif

#if WINDOWS_UWP
        // access UWP specific APIs here
#endif
~~~

While migrating LightCore to DNX Projects I used this to differ between .NET Framework and .NET Core specific implementations:

~~~ csharp
        public void InjectProperties(object instance)
        {
#if !DNXCORE50
            instance
                .GetType()
                .GetProperties(BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.SetProperty)
                .Where(this._validPropertiesSelector)
                .ForEach(p => p.SetValue(instance, this.Resolve(p.PropertyType), null));
#else
            instance
                .GetType()
                .GetProperties(BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Instance)
                .Where(_validPropertiesSelector)
                .ForEach(p => p.SetValue(instance, Resolve(p.PropertyType), null));
#endif
        }
~~~

## Conclusion

With this knowledge in mind it makes much more sense to migrate your library projects to DNX projects or to UWP projects to make your library compatible to many more platforms. Using this project types it is pretty simple to provide your features to much more platforms with a single code base. 

In the past I used multiple project files with shared code files to create libraries for more than one .NET Framework. Now I only need to add the additional framework to the project.json.
