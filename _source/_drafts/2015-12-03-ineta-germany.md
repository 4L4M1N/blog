After many years being the heads of the [INETA Germany](http://ineta-deutschland.de/), Lars Keller and Karim El-Jed, will leave the INETA Germany. The reason is, that Lars is working for Microsoft Germany since November 1st and he wants to ensure that the INETA will stay independent from Microsoft. Also the co-lead Karim will focus more on supporting his own .NET user group.

This means the INETA needed two new heads and Lars found some new.

Ulrike Stirnweiss will be the new co-lead of INETA Germany. And I write this post because I have one more reason than to only write about the news: I will be the new lead and I'm pretty proud to work with Uli to support the German .NET user groups with the speaker bureau and with budget to pay travel costs of the registered speakers.

> Maybe you read about that INETA North America will quit until the end of 2015. At the beginning of November this Year, I talked to their lead. The main reason why they will shut down is, that there seems to be no need to support the user groups in this way. It seems the North American user groups and the available speakers are well connected and they are managing all that stuff by their own. This in general is pretty cool, but the INETA North America is not longer needed if it is like this.

We will keep the INETA Germany alive and hopefully do a little more to support the German user groups and the German .NET community in general. Also INETA Europe will stay alive to provide the European speaker bureau.

Currently I have some Ideas I will discuss with Uli and I got a few pretty cool ideas by Lars, to improve the support for the German user groups and make the INETA Germany a little more viewable in the .NET Community.

For now we will keep the current jobs as defined by Lars and Karim. That means Uli will be responsible for all things around the website, marketing, and so on and I will continue with Lars Tasks: Being responsive for the Speakers Bureau, the user groups and the sponsoring.

At the End of this post I have to say Thank You to some guys.

Thanks to Lars and Karim, who will support us in the first few months being a INETA lead. :) 

Thanks to Torsten Weber who supports us in the back-end, hosting the website, mail servers, and so on. This makes this job a lot easier. :)

Thanks to our current sponsor Microsoft, which is also keeping the speaker bureau alive with the annual sponsoring. :)

If you want to be a sponsor of the INETA Germany to support the German user groups and the German .NET community please drop me an note. I'll send you detailed information about the benefits of being a sponsor.
