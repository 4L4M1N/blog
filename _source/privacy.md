This Blog uses Google Analytics to track the traffic of this web page. It also uses Google Adsense to display an add per page and to collect some money to cover the costs. We use Google Feedburner to track the RSS feed usage as well. And we use Disqus to enable page and blog post comments.

All this third party tools are not directly embedded into the blog, but loaded via JavaScript. Except Feedburner which is an external link to the RSS feed.

To opt-out don't accept this privacy statement and in case of Feesburner don't use the official one, but the private one: http://asp.net-hacker.rocks/atom.xml

## What information is being collected?

This blog doesn't collect any data directly, but uses third party tools that may or may not collect user data by tracking the users IP addresses or cookies, or by requesting for user input.

## Who is collecting it?

I use **Google Analytics** to get more insights about how much readers are visiting this blog, how much readers are reading each blog post and where the readers came from. Google added an option to anonymize the readers data and we turned that option on. In addition we enabled the option to delete the collected user data after 14 months.

I also use **Google Adsense** to get a little bit of money out of that blog. Google Adsense may collect the Readers data to track activities and interests. Please opt out at Google Adsense or turn on a an Ad-Blocker in case you don't want to get tracked. On the other hand, it would help me a little bit to cover the costs of that blog and the efford to write the posts.

And we use **Disqus** to give you the chance to drop comments to the blog posts. Disqus asks for a name and an optional email address. Feel free enter whatever you want, or whatever makes sense for you. It would be good to know your name. Disqus may offer an option to opt-out and to delete your personal data. Disqus may also track you using an IP address or an cookies.

To track the activities on our news feed, we use **Googles Feedburner**, which is also tracking reads and clicks on the feed items. I use this to get insights about the feed usages. I don't care about the individual readers, nut about the amount of readers and about the country of origin. 

## How is it collected?

Google Analytics, Google Adsense, Disqus and Googles Feedburner may use Cookies and IP address tracking. Disqus also collects the readers name and optionally his email address via a comment form on my blog posts.

## Why is it being collected?

Im pretty much interested in the number of readers on the blog and in the number of readers per blog post. This is why I track the readers activities on my blog. Google Adsense wants to provide relevant adds for you and needs to track you because of that. 

I also like to give you the chance to drop a comment, to know more about your opinion about my posts. Disqus adds this option for me.

## How will it be used?

Google and Disqus may use this information to track the visitors, to get more information about the visitory and to recognize the visitors.

I don't collect user information directly and I don't share any user information.
